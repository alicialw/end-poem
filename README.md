**Music**

This project features the music "Dead Voxel" by C418. We have permission to use the track according to the artist's guidelines, which can be found on his website: [link to C418's website - What am I allowed to do with Daniel's music?]

In accordance with these guidelines, we have:

* Used "Dead Voxel" in a creative context, not simply uploaded on its own.
* Provided proper attribution to C418 in this description.
* Not made the music available for download.
* Encouraged viewers to support C418 by purchasing his music directly.

I really appreciate C418's generosity in allowing creators to use his work.  For further information on his music and other works, please visit his website.

# About this project

**This website is a response to my front-end web programming class assignment - Interactive Media 1, a university general elective.**

* The original game color-codes dialogue, but I opted for distinct typefaces to differentiate the speakers.
* The poem scrolls slowly across the screen, taking nearly ten minutes to complete. While manual scrolling is intentionally challenging, users can press Escape to navigate. 
* The term "Minecraft aesthetic" often implies serene in-game landscapes enhanced by realistic shaders and the default texture pack. For this project, I converted real-world photos into 2D dithered images to capture a similar feel.
