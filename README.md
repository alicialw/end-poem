# About this

**This website is a course project for my HTML & CSS class - Interactive Media 1, a university general elective.**

* The original game color-codes dialogue, but I opted for distinct typefaces to differentiate the speakers.
* The poem scrolls slowly across the screen, taking nearly ten minutes to complete. While manual scrolling is intentionally challenging, users can press Escape to navigate. 
* The term "Minecraft aesthetic" often implies serene in-game landscapes enhanced by realistic shaders and the default texture pack. For this project, I converted real-world photos into 2D dithered images to capture a similar feel.
